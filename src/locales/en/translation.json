    "intro1": "At every stage of life, we face challenges that can leave us feeling disconnected from ourselves. You might feel like you've lost confidence in your ability to cope, or you're struggling to find meaning in what once felt certain.",
    "intro2": "In our sessions, I create a safe space where your story is honored without reservation. You hold the deepest wisdom about your life; my role is to walk beside you with clinical insight and therapeutic tools.",
    "intro3": "As a therapist, my priority is to offer compassionate, genuine care—especially when life feels heavy. My approach is eclectic, but I primarily use Internal Family Systems (IFS) as my guiding framework.",
    "intro4": "Deep healing begins when we approach every part of ourselves—the wounded, the angry, the lonely, even the parts we dislike—with curiosity rather than judgment.",

    "education": "Education & Credentials",
    "educationText": "I hold a Master of Science in Psychotherapy from McMaster University and am a Registered Psychotherapist (Qualifying) with the CRPO. With over six years of experience across diverse settings—from crisis helplines to community programs and family health teams—I've learned that real healing emerges when therapy is collaborative, culturally responsive, and grounded in real-world challenges.",
    "experience": "Experience",
    "experienceText": "My 3,000+ hours of counselling experience include supporting adolescents and adults through immediate relief (single-session interventions), focused growth (short-term therapy for specific goals), and deep healing (longer-term work for complex trauma). This work unfolded within organizations like the Canadian Mental Health Association, Hamilton Family Health Team, and Distress Centres of Greater Toronto.",
    "howIWork": "How I Work",
    "howIWorkText": "I specialize in helping you meet wounded, protective, or disliked aspects of yourself with curiosity—especially self-critical parts that whisper 'you're too much.' Through Internal Family Systems (IFS), we'll gently reconnect you with your calm, compassionate core Self. When we meet our inner world without judgment, we transform suffering at its source—cultivating not just balance, but enduring self-trust.",
    "beyondTherapy": "Beyond Therapy",
    "beyondTherapyText": "Beyond therapy, life with my three cats—especially my serene white companion—teaches daily lessons in boundaries, rest, and radical self-honoring. Their instinctive wisdom mirrors what I hope for you: that prioritizing your needs becomes second nature, not guilt—a foundation for authentic growth.",
    "pullQuote": "The world is not perfect, and we all hold fragments within us—parts shaped by wounds, by sorrow, by moments that left us fractured. Along the 'Way of Self,' I walk beside you as a guiding light, helping these exiled parts find safety, compassion, and finally, home.",
    "heroQuote": "Therapy is not about fixing you—it's about helping you come home to yourself.",
